This is a sql project created by Danny Ma to help individuals emerging into the data scene. From my view, it helps establish the foundational knowledge of sql while testing and developing logical problem solving skills. 

I have chosen to do it in Python because it highlights how you can create a database on your system to allow for continuous use.

Before getting started, I would recommend installing "ipython-sql". This allows you use the 'jupyter magic' function to interact with your relational database.
